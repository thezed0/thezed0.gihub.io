No Man's Sky Mapper

A crude program to help me create a visual map of planets explored and the discoveries made on them.

### Planned Features:
- Color coded based on "Type"
- Abillity to turn off/on "Types"
- Abillity to select planet of interest instead of just using URL

### Potential Features:
- A propper map projection
- Ability to auto generate a "Shore" object from screenshots (using Tesseract.js?)

### Streatch Features:
- Full server-side code and database supported application
- allow for user uploads of planets/discoveries
